Quick start for a power supplier

Problem description
-------------------

So, what does it take to be a power supplier company? All kinds of systems you need to run. Don't all power supplier companies need all the same systems? Why not create one common and open version of those systems, that all companies can use, at least to get them started?
Of course, a good deal of the distinctiveness of any particular company lies in the nature and configuration of its marketing and customer support systems, and options in these areas are plentiful. So, we won't recreate those. But possibly we do need to provide some basic way of keeping track of customers and contracts.
The main focus is on the backend systems that serve the part of the company that is perfectly transparentfor the customers. These systems support common industry processes in which the company interacts with various market parties to establish the services it provides. These are also the systems that need to be in place in order to get an operating licence from the ruling regulator party.
To narrow things down a bit further, we aim for the Dutch market exclusively for the time being. And, to be absolutely clear, we only do electricity, and no gas, water, heat, or cold. That's because we view that electricity holds the sustainable future of conveying the energy from renewable sources, and it's the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources that we want to support with this project.
